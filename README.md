Module 7 UCB work
## Summary of Results
1. Based on my analysis of Pewlett Hackard employees, there are 41,380 employees who were born between 1/1952 amd 12/31/1955, who are retiring soon. Within that, there are 501 Assistant Engineers, 4,692 Engineers, 2 Managers, 15,600 Senior Engineers, 14,735 Senior Staff, 3,837 Staff and 2,013 Technique Leaders who are going to be retiring. Please see csv table titled "retirement_by_title_challenge_table_1" for a cleaner view of this data.
2. There are 1,549 employees who are availble for the mentorship role, based on the criteria of being born in 1965. Please see csv table titled "mentorship_list_challenge_table_2" for complete details of the employees availble for the mentorship role.

PLEASE SEE "schema.sql" for technical code behind table creation for items 1 and 2, as well as the queries used to help filter the data. Challenge code begins line 199.

## Additional Recommendation
One recommendation for further analysis on this data set would be to filter the mentorship roles further, by assigning people with a subset of titles, who have the proper level of seniority, coupled with potentially more time, to help increase the focus on who would be a good fit. Another analysis to do with this data set is to see the average salary of each title for the whole company, then compare it to the average salary of the retiring employees to see how much money should be "saved" or "lost" by replacing retiring employees with an average salaried one.
